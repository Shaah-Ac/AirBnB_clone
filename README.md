Description
This project aims to create a simple version of the AirBnB website. 
It involves developing various components such as a command interpreter, a web server, database management, and a RESTful API. 
The goal is to cover fundamental concepts in higher-level programming and web development.

Command Interpreter
It serves as a tool to manipulate data without a visual interface, similar to the Shell. 
It allows users to interact with the project's functionalities and manage objects stored in the system.

How to Start
Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the console.py file using Python.

How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the system. 
These commands include creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects. 
The interpreter provides a user-friendly interface to perform these actions.

Examples
Create an Object:
(hbnb) create User name="Sharon" email="otienosharon51@gmail.com"
Show Object Information:
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678-9012
Update Object Attributes:
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678-9012 email="otienosharon51@gmail.com"
Delete an Object:
(hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678-9012
List All Objects of a Type:
(hbnb) all User
